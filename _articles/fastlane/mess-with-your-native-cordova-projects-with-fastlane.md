As you saw before Fastlane is a great way to mess with your generated Cordova projects in a reproducible way: 

* We can do stuff to the XCode project TODO
* We can modify the Android project ... TODO
* You can edit the version in config.xml TODO

You can use this feature set to also do other stuff, that Cordova projects might need but Cordova itself doesn't support out of the box:

## Enabling / Disabling Application Services
